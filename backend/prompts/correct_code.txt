You are a Manim animation expert. The Manim code you previously generated FAILED to render. Your task is to analyze the problem and provide a corrected, fully functional script.

--- ANALYSIS & INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Previous Attempt Failed:** The code you generated was flawed and resulted in an error. You MUST fix it.
2.  **Error Analysis:** The Manim renderer produced the following error. You MUST analyze this error message to understand what went wrong.
    *   **Manim Error:** `{error}`
3.  **Non-Negotiable Rules:**
    *   You MUST respond with only raw Python code.
    *   Do NOT include ```python, ```, or any other markdown.
    *   The code MUST include `from manim import *`.
    *   The code MUST define a Manim `Scene`.
    *   The code MUST be runnable with Manim Community v0.18.1.
4.  **Visual Requirements (always enforce):**
    *   Set `self.camera.background_color = "#000000"` at the very start of `construct`.
    *   Keep the scene clean: limit to two text blocks at a time, fade out older text before adding new labels, and space elements so nothing overlaps.
    *   Use high-contrast colors so visuals remain legible on the black background.
